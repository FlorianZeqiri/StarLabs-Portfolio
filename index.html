      <p class="txt-container">
        I am Florian Zeqiri, a Computer Science and Engineering student at UBT (University of Business and Technology).
        I possess great programming skills in Java, Python, HTML and CSS, eager to learn new skills on Web Development
        or Back-End Development. During my studies, I started extra-curricular certifications, which developed my skills
        even further. As part of those certifications, I had to complete multiple projects to finish them. In web
        development, I am certified in Responsive Web Design at freeCodeCamp, also certified at back-end programming
        with Django at BIT Academy.
      </p>
      <p class="txt-container">
        I gained a whole lot of technical skills during my journey as a developer, most of those skills came through
        certifications projects. For example, developing a Personal Portfolio with HTML5 and CSS3, brought new
        challenges that would push my skills further. Because of that, now I am familiar with concepts of Responsive Web
        Designing. I also learned how to better utilize tools to my advantage.
        During my work on such projects, I developed habits and non-technical skills such as researching, different
        methodologies, clean-coding habits, time-management skills and that would be of great use to me as a developer.
        I am always open to learning new things in both technical and/or non-technical skills.
        I remain hopeful that I will be given an opportunity for an interview, where we could discuss further about my
        skills and any additional information as well as the open position.
        Thank you beforehand for your time.
